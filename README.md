<b>AI Disclosure</b> 
<br>
This project was made with assistance from Generative Artificial Intelligence.
<ul>
  <li> Tools: ChatGPT and Gemini </li>
  <li> Dates: Late January, February 2-5 and 16-17, 2026</li>
  <li> Scope: Learning and gaining familiarity with the various languages, explanation of various issues, and aiding debugging</li>
  <li> Use: Gaining an initial knowledge base of Frontend and API languages as we had little prior experience, explanation of issues found on the web front in the console to deduce if the issues were on the API, Frontend, or Database side, and use of some debugging to fix problems and keep all files in sync. </li>
</ul>

All AI-generated code implemented in the LAMP project was reviewed, tested, understood, and altered to meet all requirements. The final product acts as an accurate reflection of our knowledge.
